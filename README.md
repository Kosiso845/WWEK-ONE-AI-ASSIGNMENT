# 🤖 CryptoBuddy – AI-Powered Cryptocurrency Advisor Chatbot

CryptoBuddy is a simple, rule-based chatbot built in Python to help users get basic investment suggestions based on crypto profitability and sustainability. It’s friendly, easy to interact with, and designed as part of the PLP Academy’s AI-powered chatbot assignment.

🔧 Features

- 🧠 Responds to common crypto-related questions
- 📈 Gives advice on trending coins (e.g., rising price trends)
- 🌱 Recommends eco-friendly coins based on sustainability score
- 💬 Handles unclear queries with friendly fallback responses

 How It Works

The chatbot uses predefined crypto data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. User questions are analyzed using `if-else` logic and matched to the best crypto based on rules such as:
- Price trend = “rising”
- Sustainability score > 7
- Energy use = “low”

 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3 (Beginner-friendly logic)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- String-based NLP with `.lower()` and keyword matching
- Rule-based AI (no machine learning required)

 ⚠️ Disclaimer

This chatbot is for learning purposes only and does **not offer real financial advice**. Always do your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies.
